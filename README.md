> This page is under construction and will be undergoing several revisions. Below are my notes for constructing the page.

## Step 1: UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
    - I need a way to showcase my skills as a front-end engineer on the web.
    - I do not have professional experience as a front-end engineer, but I have one year
      of experience as a back-end engineer, and two years as a Scrum Master.
        - I need a way to leverage whatever skills I may have gained through those years.
    - It is of high importance that I utilize and exhaust the applicable skills because
      this showcase is consequently my best foot forward in sharing my passion, ability,
      and craft to the world.

## Step 2: PLAN
    - I will accomplish the above through the creation of a portfolio website.
        - It will have a short introduction, and an anecdote to my history with
          the front-end and why I wish to pursue it professionaly once more.
    - It will be divided into sections:
        - Introduction
            - Hero text area
            - "thesis statement"
        - Skills
            - Learned technologies
            - Soft skills
            - Etc
        - Background
            - Anecdotes
            - Journey to front-end
        - Personal Projects
            - Portfolio
            - Under construction!
        - Work Experience
            - Dates and titles
        - Footer
            - Contact Details

## Step 3: DIVIDE AND CONQUER (IMPLEMENT)
    - Start with the textual content
        - Program using strictly only HTML5
        - Add the ability to disable the stylesheet
        - Leverage simplicity, accessibility, responsiveness
        - CSS will transform the entire website
    - Finish the general content of every area, but explicitly keep portfolio under construction
        - because you literally don't have anything to show
            - YET
