            <p>
                I'm an artist at heart, but not quite your traditional artist. Obsessed with technology since I was young, I loved how it enhanced the ways in which we interacted with the world, with each other, and with ourselves. For the longest time I seeked a way to synthesize the artist in me with technology, and a special kind of relatability. The advent of the internet then came upon us -- the perfect opportunity was born.

            <h2>Skills Background</h2>
            <h3>Research, Development, and Management</h3>
            <p>In my four years of professional experience at a telecommunications company, I spent three months of it as a front-end intern, one year as a back-end engineer, and two years and nine months as a scrum master.</p>
            <p>As an intern I developed production-ready code for Java and JavaScript software, and utilized for the first time professional coding standards and best practices. I improved my capacity to understand larger systems by learning how to isolate components to their most basic forms.</p>
            <p>Exploring more of my capabilities, I became a back-end engineer researching about and developing embedded systems used to interface with cellphones and radio towers. It was here where I delved into more complex programming concepts that were used in packet processing.</p>
            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>My journey to front-end is a strange one. I had started merely as an enthusiast, creating websites for my hobbies and at the time still utilizing iframe and table-centric interfaces and designs.</p>
